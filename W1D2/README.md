## How to approach a problem

- defined the problem (thought about SCOPE)
- break the problem into smaller problems
- conquered each problem and tested along the way
- it's ok if it isn't perfect, we can refactor!

## Live coding

- create a README
- you all contribute to the solution

### What you should do while I write code

- participated
- listened
- DID NOT code along beside me

### Demo with process.argv

### Why are you coding this?

- 

### Halp it's broken

- stay calm
- errors are your friend
- 15 minute rule
- don't say IT'S NOT WERKING

### How to search, aka how to word a problem

- real language questions
- it's nice to add the language you're using, the environment, etc.
- StackOverflow is your best friend
- Documentation is also your best friend (you have lot's of best friends)
  - MDN
  - Node
  

## Git workflow

Don't forget that your github account is your coder's portfolio, so it's always a good idea to commit often and write meaningful commit messages. A classic workflow from the creation of your project folder to publishing your changes is :

- git init (in your project folder)
- git remote add origin *URLOFYOURGITHUBREPOSITORY*
- git add . (to add everything, or name of the file instead of the .)
- git commit -m "MEANINGFUL MESSAGE"
- git push origin master

The last two steps should be done frequently, every time you completed a small goal in your project.
