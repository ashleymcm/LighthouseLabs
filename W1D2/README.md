## Git workflow

Don't forget that your github account is your coder's portfolio, so it's always a good idea to commit often and write meaningful commit messages. A classic workflow from the creation of your project folder to publishing your changes is :

- git init (in your project folder)
- git remote add origin *URLOFYOURGITHUBREPOSITORY*
- git add . (to add everything, or name of the file instead of the .)
- git commit -m "MEANINGFUL MESSAGE"
- git push origin master

The last two steps should be done frequently, every time you completed a small goal in your project.
